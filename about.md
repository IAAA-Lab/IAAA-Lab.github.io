The Advanced Information Systems Laboratory, adscribed to the Aragón Institute of Engineering Research at the Universidad Zaragoza, works on technologies for open, interoperable distributed systems in the area of spatial data and services, including geographic information systems, remote sensing, location-based services and Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDIs). This laboratory was founded by Dr. Pedro R. Muro-Medrano and it is currently led by Dr. F. Javier Zarazaga-Soria.

## Quality and Environment Policies
Quality improvement and environment preservation are among IAAA objectives and are integrated in the research group management model.Both Management and staff assume the commitment with client focused quality management and the fulfilment and disclosure of environmental values.

That’s why since July 2011, the IAAA has promoted a Quality and Environmental integrated management system, based on the UNE-EN-ISO 9001:2008(November 2008) and UNE-EN-ISO 14001:2004 (December 2004) requirements.
In addition, on October 2011 we adopted the ISO/IEC 15504 SPICE (Software Process Improvement Capability Determination) standard. SPICE is a norm to evaluate and improve process capacity and maturity that we have applied to the evaluation and quality improvement of the software development and maintenance process.

The IAAA research group, as part of its commitment with environment, undertakes to:

- Provide a maximum quality service that fulfils broadly customer and applicable environmental regulation and to set up our proper codes in those aspects where no regulation is implemented
- Manage our activity under a preventive focus to avoid later corrections.
- Reduce, when possible, waste and emissions in our activity, in our own work and in that with suppliers.
- Promote energy efficiency, reuse and recycling, and, in general, resources saving, designing properly operating processes.
- Facilitate adequate environmental information to our staff, clients, allies, suppliers and subcontractors, training and encouraging them to apply environmental good practices.
- Set up a continuous improvement system for processes, procedures and services and evaluate periodically its objectives fulfilment.
- Promote a work environment that facilitates personal development, assigning properly functions and responsibilities, providing continuous training and motivation and enhancing human and environmental values.
- Compliance with legislation and professional code of ethics.
