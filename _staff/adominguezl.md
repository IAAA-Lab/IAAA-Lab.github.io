## Professional career

Alejandro obtained a Master's degree in Architecture and a postgraduate diploma in Building Information Modeling (BIM) from Universidad San Jorge, complemented by advanced coursework in computer science, including front-end engineering, computer vision, and deep learning. Prior to his doctoral studies, he gained extensive professional experience in architectural practice, alongside academic research experience within the [Arquitecturas Open Source](https://aos.usj.es) group at the same institution. Both experiences inform his research on digital representations of the built environment and urban systems.

He is currently a PhD student in Computer Science at the Universidad Zaragoza, where his research focuses on multi-scale Urban Digital Twins and automation methods to support sustainable and data-driven urban systems.

In parallel, he works at [Centro de Observación y Teledetección Espacial (COTESA)](https://cotesa.com.es), developing digital twin strategies and platforms for public-sector innovation projects, integrating BIM, GIS, and web technologies. He is also a researcher in the European project [DECUB (Decarbonizing Urban Blocks)](https://decub-dut.eu) at Universidad San Jorge, contributing to research on urban decarbonization and digital modeling. Additionally, he collaborates with [Infozara](https://www.infozara.es/WebInfozara/) on software development initiatives related to web application development, spatial data, and urban technologies.
