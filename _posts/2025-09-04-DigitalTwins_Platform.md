Industry 4.0 has advanced in agriculture through Smart Agriculture initiatives, but open-field farming still lags in the adoption of digital twins. While digital twins have transformed manufacturing since 2011, their use in open-field agriculture remains limited by environmental variability, data scarcity, and financial constraints.

Interest in agricultural digital twins is growing, yet few solutions provide fully integrated platforms, and existing systems are often too complex for non-expert users. Unlike manufacturing, where standardized processes and abundant data enable plug-and-play solutions, open-field farming operates in uncertain, highly variable environments that are difficult to model.

This paper proposes a developer-focused, data-driven digital twin platform that establishes a Digital Twin Environment where autonomous instances coexist and communicate within shared infrastructure. Rather than pursuing standardized plug-and-play models, the platform—fully open source—empowers developers to bridge the gap between technology and farmers. It integrates proprietary and open data sources into a shared data warehouse, making digital twins accessible to farms of all sizes.

The proposed solution addresses four critical gaps:
- Affordability – avoids resource-intensive infrastructure unsuited to small farms, where real-time processing is less critical.
- Modeling complexity – replaces rigid physical models with flexible, data-driven methods better adapted to unpredictable field conditions.
- Scarcity of open-source tools – provides accessible, extensible solutions that match agriculture’s slower innovation cycle.
- Technology adoption – equips developers with a foundation to create farmer-oriented applications, fostering community-driven improvements.

A case study demonstrated platform efficiency on modest hardware (2 vCPUs, 4 GB RAM), with average CPU usage of 60%, RAM consumption of 2.5 GB, and deployment time of ~1 minute. These results confirm its suitability for small holdings with limited resources, lowering adoption barriers that have historically hindered digital transformation in open-field agriculture.
