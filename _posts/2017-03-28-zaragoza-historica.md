This new service disposes of an **interactive viewer** that makes possible to overlay a **selection of the historic maps catalogue of Zaragoza** on the actual cartography and compare the evolution of the city.

So far, there has been published a collection composed by **20 maps of XVIII, XIX, XX y XXI** centuries that will be enriched in the future.

A careful work of digitalization and georeferencing of maps, together with the availability of a mature map visualization technology, have made possible the development of this interesting tool for analysing the evolution of the city.

**“Zaragoza Histórica”** is a new service of the [Spatial Data Infrastructure of Zaragoza (IDEZar)](https://www.zaragoza.es/ciudad/idezar) whose objective is to offer citizens urban information in a simple and intuitive way by means of maps.

This work is the result of the collaboration between the **[Office of Participation, Transparency and Open Government of the City Council of Zaragoza](http://www.zaragoza.es/ciudadania/gobierno-abierto/)** and the [**Municipal Archive**](http://www.zaragoza.es/ciudad/usic/archivo) with the **Universidad de Zaragoza ([Advanced Information Systems group, IAAA]({{ site.baseurl }}/))**, in the frame of the [**ENERGIC OD project**](http://www.energic-od.eu/), an innovation project financed by the European Commission FP7. The object of this project is to generate a framework to allow homogenous distribution of open geographic information, being City Council of Zaragoza a case of use.
