*"My professional progress has been fueled by my interest in technology and its potential to enhance business and education. I have a business management degree from my academic background, which gives me a broad understanding of enterprises. I then finished a specialization in computer science for networked education, where I learned the technical know-how I needed to incorporate ICT into commercial and educational settings. This specialty was a game-changer for me professionally because it introduced me to the idea of using technology to effect change. I subsequently graduated with a master's in organizational management. Through this program, I was able to expand my understanding of technology management, an essential field for any business looking to grow and survive in the digital age. I am continuing my academic career by getting a PhD in Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) at the Universidad de la Costa, Colombia. I have been able to delve deeper into the uses of ICT in business with my PhD, particularly in the area of data analytics and its application to strategic decision-making*

*My internship in the computer science department's IAAA Laboratory at the University of Zaragoza has been a rewarding experience. My research involves using machine learning algorithms to time series data in order to anticipate the pricing of agricultural products. The goal of this research is to create predictive models that can foresee price swings, which are essential for enhancing decision-making in the agricultural supply chain. In order to maximize the planning and distribution of these items, we aim to produce more precise and practical predictions by utilizing cutting-edge machine learning algorithms.* 

*This experience at the University of Zaragoza will allow me to continue contributing to technological development and innovation in my region, contributing to its sustainability and growth in the digital era."*
